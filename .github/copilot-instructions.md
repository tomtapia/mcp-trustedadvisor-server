# MCP Trusted Advisor Server

- This is a project to build a server that implements the **Model Context Protocol**.  
- The server will use **TypeScript**, the **MCP TypeScript SDK** library, and the **AWS Support API**.  
- The purpose of this MCP server is to provide AWS customers with access to **Trusted Advisor checks** through the **AWS Support web service**.  
- The MCP server is designed as a **reusable library or module**, and **is not intended to be a web server** or any other kind of standalone application.  
- **Clean Code** and **Clean Architecture** practices should be applied to ensure clarity, maintainability, and a well-structured project.
